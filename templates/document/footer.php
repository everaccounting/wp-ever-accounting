/**
 * Document Footer Template
 *
 * The template for displaying product content within loops
 *
 * This template can be overridden by copying it to yourtheme/eac/document/footer.php
 *
 * HOWEVER, on occasion EverAccounting will need to update template files and you
 * (the theme developer) will need to copy the new files to your theme to
 * maintain compatibility. We try to do this as little as possible, but it does
 * happen. When this occurs the version of the template file will be bumped and
 * the readme will list any important changes.
 *
 * @see     https://wpeveraccounting.com/docs/
 * @package EverAccounting\Templates
 * @version 1.0.0
