 * The Template for displaying expense.
 *
 * This template can be overridden by copying it to yourtheme/eac/single-expense.php
 *
 * HOWEVER, on occasion EverAccounting will need to update template files and you
 * (the theme developer) will need to copy the new files to your theme to
 * maintain compatibility. We try to do this as little as possible, but it does
 * happen. When this occurs the version of the template file will be bumped and
 * the readme will list any important changes.
 *
 * @see     https://wpeveraccounting.com/docs/
 * @package EverAccounting\Templates
 * @version 1.0.0
 *
 * @var \EverAccounting\Models\Payment $expense Payment object.
