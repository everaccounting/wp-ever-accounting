Easy to use, flexible, and powerful. With all its built-in import/export capabilities, I was able to import categories, customers, vendors, accounts fast. I was converted in an afternoon, and had my small business accounting up and running. Wow.

And, then to see the overview charts on the dashboard. What a reward.
